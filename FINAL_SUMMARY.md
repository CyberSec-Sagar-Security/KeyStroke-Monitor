## 🚀 STEP-BY-STEP: Upload to GitHub

### Step 1: Initialize Git Repository

```powershell
cd "d:\CyberSecurity\Cyber_Security_Future_Projects\Keylogger"

# Initialize git
git init

# Configure git (replace with your details)
git config user.name "CyberSec-Sagar-Security"
git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
```

### Step 2: Add Remote Repository

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/CyberSec-Sagar-Security/KeyStroke-Monitor.git
```

### Step 3: Stage All Files

```powershell
# Check what will be added
git status

# Add all files (respecting .gitignore)
git add .

# Verify .gitignore is working
git status
# Should NOT show: logs/ config.json TEST_RESULTS.json
```

### Step 4: Create Initial Commit

```powershell
git commit -m "Initial commit: Educational KeyStroke Monitor v2.0

Features:
- Consent-based typing behavior analysis tool
- Educational cybersecurity research application
- Local-only data storage with AES encryption
- Professional terminal UI with comprehensive features
- Full legal disclaimers and ethical guidelines
- Session management and statistics tracking
- Window context and process monitoring
- Typing speed analysis (WPM/CPM)

Purpose: Academic research and security education only."
```

### Step 5: Push to GitHub

```powershell
# For main branch
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# OR if using master branch
git push -u origin master
```

## 📸 Adding Screenshot (Optional but Recommended)

### Step 1: Create images folder

```powershell
mkdir images
```

### Step 2: Take a clean screenshot

Take a screenshot showing:
- Legal warning screen
- Main menu
- OR session statistics (with test data)

Save as: `images/screenshot.png`

### Step 3: Update README.md

Replace the line `**[Paste image here]**` in README.md with:

```markdown
![KeyStroke Monitor Interface](images/screenshot.png)
```

### Step 4: Commit and push

```powershell
git add images/screenshot.png README.md
git commit -m "Add application interface screenshot"
git push
```
